    <h3>My First Scratch Game</h3>
    <p> The purpose of this game was to collect fruits and switch costumes which was the character<br>
    in the game. I utilized the looping variables and motion variables to continually make the character move. <br>
    The part where I was stuck on was being able to make the character switch from left to right to obtain the fruits<br>
    that were in random places.

    <h3>Panda Panda Panda</h3>
    <p>
      Panda Panda Panda was a game created by my partner Lina and I. The purpose of this game was to have <br>
      the panda collect as much bamboo as possible to add onto his bowl of ramen. If he does not get bamboo, he<br>
      cannot eat his ramen in peace. In order to create this game,we solely based our game on the if-then variables <br>
      and motion variables such as using the x and y position to correctly position the panda on the screen<br>
      and enabling it to move around. For me, the most challenging part about creating the game was<br>
      being able to change backgrounds and enabling the panda to do its own script even  after the backdrop switches.<br>
      I also had problems with making the loops and making the panda glide across the screen.
